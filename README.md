# Blackjack Teacher

## Description
This program simulates dealing an initial hand in Blackjack. The user can input what action they would like to do depending on the dealer's card and their cards. The action is checked against the perfect blackjack strategy actions, which can be seen below in the attached image.

## Download and Run
To try the program, download and execute the jar file: `java -jar blackjack-teacher-1.0.jar`

## Updates
The program is run in the command line, and a GUI version is still being worked on. To try the current GUI version, uncomment `new GUI()` and comment out `new BlackjackCLI()` in App.java. Then rebuild the jar or run in an IDE.
If anyone has ideas or comments, feel free to reach out!
