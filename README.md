# blackjack-teacher
Simulates blackjack hands and teaches correct hit/stand/double down/split decisions.
When starting a new hand, the one card is dealt to the dealer and two to the player.
The player selects an option: hit, stand, double down, or split.
If the option selected was correct, the button background displays green.
If the option selected was incorrect, the button background displays red.
The user can continue playing the hand like a normal game of blackjack,
and a tally of wins, losses, and draws is displayed throughout a session.
